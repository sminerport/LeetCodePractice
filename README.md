# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains a collection of C# solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem is implemented in the **Problems** project with accompanying unit tests in the **Tests** project. A small console **Runner** is available for adâ€‘hoc experiments, and a **Benchmarks** project uses BenchmarkDotNet to measure performance of selected implementations.

## Projects

| Project    | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Problems` | Implementations of algorithmic problems. Each class contains XML documentation and multiple methods when relevant. Target framework is `net9.0`. |
| `Tests`    | xUnit tests covering the solutions. Run with `dotnet test`. |
| `Runner`   | Console application for manual testing or demonstration. Execute with `dotnet run --project Runner`. |
| `Benchmarks` | BenchmarkDotNet project for performance comparisons. Run with `dotnet run -c Release --project Benchmarks`. |

The solution file `LeetCodePractice.sln` groups all projects together.

## Building and Testing

Ensure the .NET SDK (version 9.0 preview or later) is installed. From the repository root:

```bash
# Restore dependencies
 dotnet restore

# Run unit tests
 dotnet test
```

To execute the console runner or benchmarks:

```bash
# Run the sample console app
 dotnet run --project Runner

# Run benchmarks (Release configuration recommended)
dotnet run -c Release --project Benchmarks
```

A `.gitignore` file is included to exclude common build artifacts such as `bin/`
and `obj/` directories.
